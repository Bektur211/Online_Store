# Online Store

*Note: I wrote only the frontend part, I did not touch the backend.*

_Error: When trying to add a device, an error occurs. Until I figured out what to do with it, I need to discuss it with the backender._

***A little about the app***

This is an online store, with an admin panel, with registration and authorization by jwt token. Database: PostgreSql. This is a small online store, where you can see details of each product, there is pagination on the home page, there is a filter by type and brand, exit and login to the account.
